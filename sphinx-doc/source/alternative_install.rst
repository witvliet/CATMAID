Setting up Nginx for CATMAID
============================

Of course, using Apache and its WSGI module (mod_wsgi) is not the only
way to run CATMAID. There are many web and WSGI servers available.
This section is intended to provide information on such
alternatives, and in particular the use of Nginx and various
WSGI servers.

The installation instructions provided here, assume that you have set up
the database and Django as described in the standard installation
instructions.

Setup based on Nginx and Gevent
-------------------------------

`Nginx  <http://nginx.org/>`_ is a web server with focus on high performance
and concurrency while maintaining a low memory footprint. However, it is
(by default) not a WSGI server and one needs to set this up separately. Here,
we will use `Gevent <http://gevent.org/>`_ to provide this functionality. It
is a WSGI server is based on Python `coroutines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine>`_
and `greenlets <http://greenlet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Of course, you need to install Nginx, and the libevent package if you will use gevent.
In Debian based distributions, this can be done with::

  sudo apt-get install nginx libevent-dev

Nginx can be started after this.

Gevent in turn is a Python module. To make it usable, activate the *virtualenv*
and install Gevent by running::

  pip install gevent

After this, Gevent is usable. In the next sections we will configure both
the web and the WSGI server.

Nginx configuration
###################

A good general introduction to Nginx configuration can be found
`here <http://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2010/07/nginx-primer/>`_. In the
following, a Nginx configuration is provided to give access to CATMAID:

.. code-block:: nginx

  upstream catmaid-wsgi {
      server 127.0.0.1:8080;
  }

  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name <CATMAID-HOST>;

      # Give access to Django's static files
      location /catmaid/static/ {
          alias <CATMAID-PATH>/django/static/;
      }

      # Route all CATMAID Django WSGI requests to the Gevent WSGI server
      location /catmaid/ {
          proxy_pass http://catmaid-wsgi/;
          proxy_redirect http://catmaid-wsgi/ http://$host/;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
  }

This setup expects CATMAID to be accessible from a `catmaid` subdirectory
under the domain's root. To use this configuration when CATMAID lives on
the domain's root, just remove `/catmaid` from every location block (and
do the same in Django's settings.py, of course).

The first block (upstream) defines where the Gevent server will be available.
In this case, we assumed we can access it under `127.0.0.1:8080`. The server
block defines the actual web server.

There you have to adjust `<CATMAID-HOST>` to where your CATMAID instance
should be available (e.g. catmaid.example.org). The first location block
defines from where the static files should be served. The `<CATMAID-PATH>`
placeholder needs to be replaced with the absolute path to your CATMAID
folder. The second location block passes all requests to the WSGI server
defined before and allows therefore the execution of Django.

A note on the ``proxy_redirect`` command
****************************************

In general, this command modifies the *Location* and the *Refresh* HTTP header
fields in the header of a redirect reply of the proxied server. In our case
this is the WSGI server, running CATMAID. Redirects happen e.g. as the correct
response to HTTP POST request (which e.g. happen if you change something from
within the admin interface). The first URL gets replaced by the second one,
i.e.  ``http://catmaid-wsgi/`` with ``http://$host/``. The
`$host <http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#.24host>`_ variable is the header's
*Host* field and therefore the host CATMAID is running on. This makes the
outside world see the front end server in the request URLs---a good thing and
if CATMAID is *not* running in a subdirectory, one can remove this line and the
default behavior should just work. The
`default behavior <http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_redirect>`_
replaces the URL given to ``proxy_pass`` with the path of the whole
``location`` block. When CATMAID doesn't live in a subdirectory, this is
equivalent to:

.. code-block:: nginx

  proxy_redirect http://catmaid-wsgi/ /;

This is fine, so the line could be removed, but it gets a problem if CATMAID
lives in a subdirectory. The default behavior would then translate to (wrt. to
the configuration above):

.. code-block:: nginx

  proxy_redirect http://catmaid-wsgi/ /catmaid/;

If CATMAID lives in a subdirectory, you likely also have the
``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`` property in your settings file set accordingly (e.g. to
``/catmaid``). In short, this leads Django to prepend every generated URL with
this path. If in a subdirectory, it is needed for all types of HTTP
requests---not only, but also for redirects. This in turn results in prepending
the subdirectory twice for redirect requests: 1. Django does it due to
``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`` 2. Nginx does it when ``proxy_redirect`` is used with its
default behavior (e.g. if left out). To fix this, the rewrite of proxies
redirects has to be explicitly set to rewrite the WSGI URL to ``$host`` or to
``/``, i.e. to:

.. code-block:: nginx

  proxy_redirect http://catmaid-wsgi/ http://$host/;

Therefore, it is is part of the above configuration.

Gevent run script
#################

To start Gevent, a small Python script is used. It is best to place it in::

  <CATMAID-path>/django/projects/mysite/

There, you put the following lines into a file (e.g. run-gevent.py)::

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  # Import gevent monkey and patch everything
  from gevent import monkey
  monkey.patch_all(httplib=True)

  # Import the rest
  from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler as DjangoWSGIApp
  from django.core.management import setup_environ
  from gevent.wsgi import WSGIServer
  import sys
  import settings

  setup_environ(settings)

  def runserver():
      # Create the server
      application = DjangoWSGIApp()
      address = "127.0.0.1", 8080
      server = WSGIServer( address, application )
      # Run the server
      try:
          server.serve_forever()
      except KeyboardInterrupt:
          server.stop()
          sys.exit(0)
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      runserver()

If executed, this will start a Gevent server on IP 127.0.0.1 and port 8080.
Adjust those values to your liking.

Having configured and started both servers, you should now be able to access
CATMAID.

Setup based on Nginx and uWSGI
------------------------------

`uWSGI <http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/>`_ is a versatile WSGI server written in C,
and can serve as the middle layer between Nginx and CATMAID.

On Ubuntu 12.04, install nginx and uwsgi::

  sudo apt-get install nginx uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python

Here is a sample uWSGI configuration file.  On Ubuntu, this can be saved as 
*/etc/uwsgi/apps-available/catmaid.ini*, with a soft link to */etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/catmaid.ini*::

  ; uWSGI instance configuration for CATMAID
  [uwsgi]
  virtualenv = /home/alice/.virtualenvs/catmaid
  chdir = <CATMAID-PATH>/django
  socket = /run/uwsgi/app/catmaid/socket
  mount = /=<CATMAID-path>/django/projects/mysite/django.wsgi
  plugins = python
  ; manage-script-name is required if CATMAID will be run in a subdirectory
  manage-script-name = true

You now be able to start uWSGI manually with one of the following::

   uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/catmaid.ini 
   (or)
   service uwsgi start catmaid.ini

Here is a sample nginx configuration file::

  server {
      listen 8080;
      server_name <CATMAID-HOST>;

      # Give access to Django's static files
      location /catmaid/static/ {
         alias <CATMAID-PATH>/django/static/;
      }

      # Route all CATMAID Django WSGI requests to uWSGI
      location /catmaid/ {
          include uwsgi_params;
          uwsgi_pass unix:///run/uwsgi/app/catmaid/socket;
      }
  }

Setup based on Nginx and Gunicorn
---------------------------------

For using the Gunicorn WSGI server, the same Nginx configuration
can be used as that given above for use with gevent.  (You may
need to change the port, however.)  As an example of how to
start Gunicorn, there is a upstart script, suitable for Ubuntu,
in ``django/projects/mysite/gunicorn-catmaid.conf``.  You would
copy this to ``/etc/init/``, customize it, and start Gunicorn
with ``initctl start gunicorn-catmaid``.  (Thereafter it will be
started on boot automatically, and can be restarted with
``initctl restart gunicorn-catmaid``.
