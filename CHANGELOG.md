### Features and enhancements

Key shortcuts / mouse operations:

- Shift+T removes all tags from the currently active node.

- After using R to go the nearest open leaf, shift+R cycles through other open
  leaves in the skeleton in order of ascending distance from the starting
  location. Combining alt with these operations orders open leaves by most
  recent creation instead of distance.

- Ctrl+Y removes the active skeleton from the last used selection widget.

- Shift+Y selects skeletons within a radius of the active node in the tracing
  layer and adds them to the last used selection widget. Ctrl+shift+Y works in
  the same way to remove skeletons from the last used selection widget.

- If the next (or previous) branch/end point is already selected when V (or B)
  is pressed, the view will center on it nevertheless.

- If the mouse is over the stack when zooming, the view will recenter so that
  the same stack location remains under the mouse at the new scale.


Review system:

- New "Reviewer Team" system allows filtering reviews in visualizations and
  statistics to include only those by particular reviewers. Each user can
  control which reviewers to include in her team. A date can be configured for
  each reviewer in the team, so that only reviews from that reviewer after this
  date are included.
  * A user's reviewer team is configured through the Settings widget.
  * The review widget includes a team column between the user and union columns.
  * The percent reviewed column in the selection widget can be set to team or
    union.
  * Team review coloring is available in the 3D viewer and group graph.


3D viewer:

- With Ctrl + mouse wheel, only the camera is moved in target direction, the
  target stays fixed. If Alt + mouse wheel is used, the target moves as well.

- The CSV export not also includes the parent ID for each node, which can be
  used to reconstruct the topological tree.

- The auto-created selection widget is now 50% smaller, giving more vertical
  space to the 3D viewer.

- With the help of controls of the Animation tab, simple animations can be
  played. Currently, rotation around the X, Y and Z axis as well as the current
  "up" direction of the camera. is supported. The back-and-forth mode will
  reverse rotation direction once a full circle is reached. With the help of the
  stepwise visibility option, individual neurons can be made visible after a
  certain amount of time the animation is running. Additionally, neurons can be
  made sequentially visible after each rotation.

- Animations can also be exported as WebM movie file. The "Export animation"
  button in the Export tab, will show a dialog with basic export settings. Like
  with the other view export options, the current 3D view setup is used. The
  frame size can be adjusted in the export dialog. Creating the file can take
  some seconds and currently only works for the Chrome browser (due to the lack
  of WebP support in others). The resulting WebM video file can be converted to
  any other format using e.g. VLC player, if needed.

- New shading mode "synapse-free chunks". Has one parameter, the minimum amount
of synapse-free cable to consider between two consecutive synapses, adjustable
from tge "Shading Parameters" tab.

- New shading mode "dendritic backbone". Depends on 'microtubules end' tags, or
will approximate twigs by using the Strahler number entered in the "Shading
Parameters" tab.

- The view settings tab now contains a control to scale the size of the node
  handles (e.g. active node, special tags).


Connectivity widget:

- It is now possible to remove added neurons again. Each row of the table of
  target neurons now contains a small 'x' icon in the first column to remove it.


Analyze Arbor:

- Options are provided to approximate twigs by using a branch Strahler number
defined in the "Options".

- Dimensions of the pie charts and XY plots is now configurable from the
"Options" dialog.


Graph widget:

- New button to "Clone" the graph widget: opens a new widget with identical content.

- New buttons to "Save" and "Open..." to/from JSON, so that complex graphs can be
reloaded later on. Skeletons not present in the database are not loaded.


Miscellaneous:

- Selecting tags for highlighting in the neuron dendrogram


Admin:

- For projects, stacks, overlays and data views there is now the option to
  duplicate objects from within the admin view. To copy objects without their
  relations, there is now a new action in the list view's action menu. To
  duplicate an entity with its relations, select the object and use the "save as
  new" button.


Export:

- A basic JSON export of all treenodes and connectors of the selected neurons is
  now possible.


### Bug fixes

Tracing overlay:

- Trying to remove a non-existent tag from a node now doesn't show an error
  dialog anymore, but only a notification.


Key shortcuts / mouse operations:

- Fix bug where tagged nodes were not considered open by R regardless of tag
  content.


Neuron search:

- Make neuron names wrap and use the next line, if there is not enough space for
  it. This makes the table not expand in width until the name fits anymore.


3D viewer:

- Picking a synapse or other selectable elements is now more robust and now
  works also in orthographic mode.

- The projection mode (orthographic or perspective) is now also stored in a
  saved view.

- The 3D viewer's drawing canvas is now correctly sized again. Since the tab
  panel has been introduced, the 3D viewer has been too high. Now the
  pre-defined views (XY, XZ, ZY, ZX) are display correctly again, i.e. the whole
  bounding box is now seen again.

- Performance enhancement when smoothing skeletons with a Gaussian by avoiding
to update the same Vector3 instances twice.


Reviews:

- Pressing 'E' during review will now go to the next unreviewed segment as seen
  from the currently reviewed one. Before, the first unreviewed segment as seen
  from the top of the table was selected.

- Pressing 'Q' on the first node (leaf) brings one back one section to check if
  the segment really ends. Pressing 'W' afterwards now brings one back to the
  first node, not the second like it has been before.

Miscellaneous:

- Vertical resizing of widgets now doesn't lead to strange size changes anymore.

- An alternative DVID tile source was added to support its multiscale API.


## 2015.1.21

### Features and enhancements

General neuron tracing:

- A new radius editing option has been added that propagates from the current
  node root-ward to the previous node with an undefined radius (exclusive).
  Here undefined is taken to be a negative radius, since though the column
  default is 0 Django initializes it to -1.

Miscellaneous:

- Users need now to confirm the closing of the last stack.


### Bug fixes

Tracing overlay:

- A label is now hidden when the mouse hovers over it. Note that this only works
  for one label at a time, so it is not effective for overlapping labels. A
  robust solution would require more expensive event propagation over label
  elements.

- Fullscreen on OS X Safari should now work, too.

- Nodes and arrows are now drawn in order: lines, arrows, nodes, labels

- Fix bug that could occur during radius propagation when the previous node
  already had a radius defined.

- Fix mouse handlers of node and error drawing, which were broken by adding
  ordered drawing.


Synapse clustering:

- A long-standing error has been fixed where a few nodes where added to an
  undefined cluster.


Group graph:

- The root node computation has been fixed.

- Listing edge synapses now also works with split grouped neurons.


3D viewer:

- Make synapse clustering fetch synapses properly (like it is done in the Group
  Graph).


## 2015.1.15

Key shortcuts / mouse operations:

- A new shortcut key to navigate to a node's child has been added: ]. It
  behaves like V by navigating to the largest descendant branch. With
Shift+] one cycles through sibling branches in order of descending
size.

- For consistency, the P shortcut to navigate to the parent has been
replaced with [.

- Navigation to the next branch has changed a bit: The V key now moves
to the next branch node or end of the largest descendant branch of the
active node, and subsequent presses of shift+V cycle through other
possible descending branches in order of decreasing size.

- While editing the radius of a node with the help of the surrounding
circle, a click will confirm the current radius (not only pressing 'o'
again). The radius editing can now also be canceled with the Esc key.

- With Ctrl+Alt+click one can now insert a node into the active
skeleton between two existing nodes.


Zoom:

- Zooming is now also possible in smaller steps. The plus and minus
buttons zoom in steps of 1 and with having the Shift key pressed
additionally, steps of 0.1 are used.


3D viewer:

- New export options (Export tab):
  * CVS representation of the rendered skeletons;
  * PNG and SVG image of the current view;
  * SVG catalogue of the current view. The catalogue contains each
neuron a separate panel on the same SVG document--very useful to
generate figures for a paper. Options are provided to sort and arrange
panels, and to define pinned neurons that appear in each panel (e.g. a
somatosensory axon that acts as reference for each neuron connected to
it).

- New "Spatial select" button (Main tab) that allows to select
skeletons near the active node or connected to the active skeleton,
within a specified distance. Matching skeletons will be shown in a new
selection table. This is useful to e.g. select all single-node
skeletons connected to the dorsal lobe part of a Kenyon cell.

- Supports orthographic projection (see checkbox in View tab) so that
no perspective distortion is applied and distances become comparable
between different parts of the view.

- The 3D viewer now has the option to follow the active node (View
tab). This acts like clicking "Center active" after each active node
change.

- One can bookmark views in the 3D viewer, by pressing "Save view" in
the Main tab. Views can be loaded by selecting them from the drop down
list next to the button. These bookmarks are currently discarded once
CATMAID is reloaded.

- When Ctrl is pressed while zooming in the 3D viewer with the scroll
wheel, the camera is actually moved towards its target. This is useful
to overcome zooming limits and strong perspective distortion due to a
high focal length when zooming.


Selection table:

- "Randomize colors" in the selection table was replaced by a drop
down list with different color schemes and the button "Colorize" to
apply the selected one. The default is the coloring scheme that
existed before. Some of the new color schemes are from Cynthia Brewer
(see http://colorbrewer2.org/ ).

- Neurons are activated by clicking on the name, like in all other
widgets. The green tick icon has been removed.

- New check box for each neuron called "meta" to toggle the display of
extra information like the orange spheres for specially tagged nodes
(TODO, uncertain end, etc.) or low confidence nodes.


Dendrogram:

- Can now collapse nodes belonging to a branch that ends in a node
tagged "not a branch".

- One can now highlight multiple tags in the dendrogram by separating
them with commas.


Graph widget:

- Subgraphs (like axon & dendrite) can now be reset in the graph widget.


Annotations:

- When adding an annotation, the pattern "{nX}" can be used to add an
automatically incrementing number to each neuron annotated, starting
at X. So if e.g. three neurons are annotated at once with the
annotation "test-{n5}", the first one is annotated with "test-5", the
second one with "test-6" and the last one with "test-7". Omitting X
will be interpreted to start from 1.

- When skeletons are joined, the name of the "losing" skeleton can now
be added as an annotation to the "winning" skeleton right in the
dialog. Its checkbox is unchecked by default, if the name follows the
auto-generated name pattern "neuron 12345".


Searching:

- The neuron name input boxes in both search widgets will now remember
entries that have been used before.


Handling the unexpected:

- A general error handler has been added so that CATMAID should
hopefully not crash anymore, even if an error occurs. In such
situations an error dialog is shown and the error is logged on the
server so that we can investigate better what went wrong.


General neuron tracing:

- A robust synapse clustering method was added: centrifugal synapse flow
centrality. Many widgets now support a new method for finding axons based on it
(e.g. in the 3D viewer as a shading method.

- The connector table now displays the confidence of each link

- Basic import/export support was added. There are two new management commands
  that can be used by admins to import and export tracing data.


Users and groups:

- Support user registration (disabled by default). Default user groups for new
  users can be set.


Miscellaneous:

- A new ROI tool was added, which can be activated for each user through the
user settings. It currently supports only the creation of new ROIs. Additional
sub-tools will be added for more functionality.
